# Guamolsa AI System Optimization 

## Description 
This repository contains the development of a machine learning solution for Guamolsa, a company specializing in the production of egg cartons and disposable cup holders. 

The objective of this project is to implement an AI system capable of automatically regulating the water and pulp flow rates during the production process. This optimization is intended to maintain an ideal 40%-60% mixture, leveraging real-time sensor data, including six additional variables whose roles are yet to be identified.
